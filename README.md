## Development

This project is developed with sass and gulp.
You don't have to install sass or ruby because we use node-sass and gulp-sass, but you still need to have gulp installed globally.

+ `npm run dev` or `gulp dev`

## Customize

It's recommended to customize dashboard to build your own ui styles.To do this, you just need to add a theme file in the `src/theme` folder.

Have a look at the `src/theme/theme-light.scss` file and you will know how to build your own theme.
